# Graphite

A Jekyll theme focusing on typography.

Live [Demo](https://jpasholk.com/Graphite/)

This theme is mostly for me to learn about how to actually design, instead of using a framework.

Things I'm focusing on are:

* Great Typography
* Overall design
* Learning to use Sass
* Exploring Jekyll a bit more.
