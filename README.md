### Stunning Typography

With the [Inter Ui](https://rsms.me/inter/) Font Family front and center, it's hard to mess up how the text looks. Created by Rasmus Anderson to be used for reading text on screens.

> Inter UI is a typeface specially designed for user interfaces with focus on high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens.

> The family features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text.

# Things still todo:

* Categories
* Collections
* Forms from Formspree
* Comments - probably not Disqus, unless requested
* Refactor code to be better organized and DRYer.
* When everything is said and done, package it up as a gem.
